= rake_commit_tasks

This plugin contains a set of rake tasks for checking your project into subversion.  The most important is:

  rake commit

which:

  1. Adds new files to subversion
  2. Deletes missing files from subversion
  3. svn update
  4. Runs the default rake task (which should run your tests)
  5. Displays svn status
  6. Checks cruisecontrol.rb to see if the build is passing
  7. Prompts to check in


The first version started with the code posted at Jay Field's Blog: http://blog.jayfields.com/2006/12/ruby-rake-commit.html
Improvements have been added in from several more projects.

== Installation

  git clone git://github.com/pgr0ss/rake_commit_tasks.git vendor/plugins/rake_commit_tasks
  rake commit

== Customization

If you want the build to check your cruisecontrol.rb instance and prompt you 
before checking in on a broken build, set CCRB_RSS to the location of the RSS feed.

For example, in your Rakefile:

  CCRB_RSS = 'http://example.com:3333/projects.rss'
