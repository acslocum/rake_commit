Started with the code at Jay Field's blog: http://blog.jayfields.com/2006/12/ruby-rake-commit.html

== Additions

* Don't prompt to check in if nothing has changed
* Use readline instead of gets so you can use the arrow keys and backspace
* Break if there are conflicts in svn up
* Donâ€™t add result of conflicts to subversion (.mine, etc)
* Check cc.rb and prompt if build is failing
* Store previous pair and message in system temp path instead of source tree
* Properly handle missing directories by first restoring them and then svn removing them
* Handle file names with spaces by quoting the svn commands
* Prompt for a story number
* Show example at prompt if there is no previously entered data
* Refactor saved data handling
* Added a svn:revert_all task which reverts all modified files and deletes all new files
